          Shrohmie Council gives voice to 1st Gen holders by allowing the
          community to participate in the direction of Mushrohms. Once weekly on
          Wednesdays at 7pm UTC the Shrohmie Council meets to discuss
          initiatives, collaborations, alpha, proposals, and more. Mushrohms
          currently manages a 6-figure Shrohmie Treasury to continue to fund and
          grow the project. The Shrohmie community is the lifeblood of
          Mushrohms, and so transparency and camaraderie are the main aims of
          the Shrohmie Council. At this time, the Shrohmie Council is exclusive
          to verified 1st Gen Mushrohm NFT holders.
        </p>
        <p>
          Participation in the council, as well as other Mushrohm related
          events, are rewarded with unique collectible Shrohmie Cap POAPs. The
          non-transferable Shrohmie Caps are a way for Shrohmies to measure and
          flex their Mushrohm related achievements, and plans are underway to
          reward holders of a certain number of Shrohmie Caps with unique perks
          and airdrops. Shrohm on frens!
