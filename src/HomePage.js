                Sporedrops are a unique airdrop mechanism of 1st Gen Mushrohms,
                and work to grow the Mushrohms mycelial network to new chains
                and environments. 1st Gen Mushrohms qualify for a sporedrop
                depending on their unique properties. So far the two properties
                have received a sporedrop are the Dawn and Night properties.
              </p>
              <p>
                All holders of a 1st Gen Dawn Mushrohm were airdropped a special
                Prometheus Spore NFT, and all holders of a 1st Gen Night
                Mushrohm were airdropped a special Hades Spore NFT, both on the
                Polygon Network. In addition, new participants were given a
                chance to whitelist for the sporedrop. Nine days after the
                initial sporedrop, the Hades Spore and Prometheus Spore grew
                into one of four unique rarity tiers of new Descendant
                Mushrohms.
              </p>
              <p>
                1st Gen Mushrohms will continue to receive new sporedrops over
                time, thought the qualifying properties and blockhain remain
                unrevealed. Through sporedrops, Mushrohms continue to colonize
                new environments and expand their Kingdom!

                Mushrohms: Descendants are the newest addition to the Mushrohms
                collection, born of the Prometheus and Hades Sporedrops. The
                Prometheus Sporedrop released the gifts of fiery insight across
                Mt. Olympus, while the Hades Sporedrop brought from the
                Underworld the wisdom of the great beyond! Both grew from unique
                Spore NFTs airdropped to holders of a 1st Gen via the sporedrop
                mechanism, and are currently on the Polygon Network.

              <p>
                Descendant Mushrohms qualify holders for exclusive whitelists

            Mushrohm Tribes is an interactive PFP project that seeks to expand
            the narrative of the Mushrohm Kingdom. In the early days of Mt.
            Olympus, the Mushrohm Tribes lived in harmony with the Shrohms that
            grew throughout the mountain. Four unique tribes formed: the Dawn
            Tribe, the Night Tribe, the Prometheus Tribe, and the Hades Tribe.
            Each with their own abilities and values, the fascinating lore of
            the tribes will be told. Coming soon to the Mushrohm Kingdom. Coming
            soon...
